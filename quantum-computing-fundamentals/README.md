# quantum-computing-fundamentals
Developed foundational quantum computing skills using Python's Qiskit framework and Jupyter Notebook through hands-on programming projects.

Key accomplishments include:

Visualized qubit states using Bloch sphere representations.
Implemented qubit initialization in binary basis states and superposition.
Applied Pauli gates (X, Y, Z) to construct and manipulate quantum circuits.
Performed quantum measurements and analyzed probability distributions.
Built quantum circuits for practical applications, including a quantum random number generator.
Simulated quantum algorithms and analyzed measurement outcomes.
Successfully implemented quantum entanglement protocols between multiple qubits.
Executed quantum teleportation algorithm to transfer quantum states between distant qubits.
Analyzed quantum systems using state vectors and mathematical representations.

This hands-on experience provided practical exposure to core quantum computing principles including superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement.
